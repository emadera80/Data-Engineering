# DVD Rental Data warehouse.  

For this project I will be showcasing my skills on how to transform a 3NF database into a start schema.  I will be using the postgres sample database dvdRental which contains a normalize database.  

A little background on the database.  The database is a fictitions movie rental database. This is a database simalar to blockbuster stores movie rental to netflix.   The database contains films information, actor, payment, rental date, inventory, language, city, address, staff and other tables.  

From a fictitous standpoint if a manager would like to view a report of top 10 grossing moving and sliced by city and the staff, the manager will have to write a query with many joins in order to get the results.   

Below is the data model for the dvdrental data base.
